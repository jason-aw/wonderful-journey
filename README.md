# Wonderful Journey

This web application is the final exam project for my Web Programming course. The website is Wonderful Journey, a blog website that features tourism destinations in Indonesia. Users are allowed to write their travelling experience when enjoying their travel in Indonesia. 

To test out the application run these commmands:
* `php artisan migrate` to migrate the tables to the database
* `php artisan db:seed` to seed the database
* `php artisan storage:link` to create a symbolic link from the `/storage/` folder to the `/public/storage/`
* `php artisan serve` to start the web application

Note: database name is `finalexam`
